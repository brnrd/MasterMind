School project : a tournament organizer for the "MasterMind federation"

We were asked to create an graphical application to organize tournaments.

We had to manage the players, the tournament and the match.

The idea for this app was to make it as easy as possible to use. So I decided to give it a "Google" look.
The search bar is in every single view of the app. The players are organized as the Contacts in Gmail as well as the tournaments.
